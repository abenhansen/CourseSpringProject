# CourseSpringProject
Mandatory 2

This program cotains a login system with three different roles, TEACHER, STUDENT, ADMIN.

Each role can only do their function and acces them, so a student cannot access or see the button to create a course, etc.

If a Teacher is logged in he can go to the list of courses where he can see all the courses available. On that page a teacher can create
a new course, and assign teachers from the database into the course. A teacher can also edit, and delete a course.

If a Student is logged in he can see a list of available courses, and then he can press the join course page, whre he can choose among the
created courses and sign up for all of the courses he wants to join. He cannot apply for a course as if he were a student.

If an Admin is logged in he can do the same functions as Teacher, but he also have his own page where he can see all of the students
registered. On that page he can either delete the student from the system and reject them completly, or he can press the button
called approve or reject, where he can see the name fo the student and then choose the courses that he approves and leaves the courses he rejects empty. He also got the option to press none, where the student will have no courses at all.
